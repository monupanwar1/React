# React Form Handling Techniques

This repository explores three common techniques used for handling forms in React:

1. **useRef**:
    - The `useRef` hook is utilized to create mutable objects with the `.current` property. By default, it's initialized to null. This technique is particularly useful for directly referencing form elements where needed within the form section.

2. **useRef for Form Handling**:
    - Building upon the `useRef` hook, this technique extends its usage to handle form inputs. References are passed to form elements and accessed to retrieve their values or manipulate focus, providing a straightforward approach to form management.

3. **useState**:
    - The `useState` hook offers a more declarative approach to form handling. With this technique, form input values are stored in state variables and updated as users interact with the form. This method provides greater flexibility and control over form state management.

## Usage
Explore each technique's folder for detailed examples and explanations on how to implement and leverage them in your React projects.
